## Notes

- Accounts, canvas projects, assets, preferences, and provider API keys are managed through Supabase; canvas data syncs to Supabase with the signed-in account, and WebDAV remains an optional extra export channel.
- AI requests are sent directly from the browser to user-configured endpoints; a local forwarding proxy is available when CORS blocks them.
